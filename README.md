In this repository, I explore some of the open data sets (added gradually)
released by Vancouver city at

http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm

Each directory name should roughly correspond to the name of the dataset on the
above web page.

Within each directory, the exploration results are recorded in the EDA.ipynb.
EDA means exploratory data analysis.
